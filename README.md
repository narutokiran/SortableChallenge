I have used HashMap and Trie data structres to implment the Sortable challenge. This code can be run by using the following command.

sh Run_UnixOrLinux.sh products.txt listings.txt result.txt

I have used json-simple-1.1.1.jar. If this script is not working, then you may have to set the json-simple-1.1.1.jar to the classpath.
